# CamLab-IterativeOptimisation

Simple VB.NET code to use iterative optimisation to focus light to a point through a scattering medium or a multimode fibre. Uses a direct search approach, whereby a portion of the SLM pixels are changed at random. If this change creates a brighter intensity at the desired output point the change is adopted. Else, it is rejected.
